# Portfolio build for Technigo 2020

Notes on this week's project: 
I'm not sure why this week was so challenging for me but I'm not feeling good about what I'm handing in this round. I was only able to get as far as putting together the mobile view, but also I went mobile-first so really, there's only one finished view (more or less). There are little things I would like to fix and I made some good progress on banging out a tablet-view this weekend but it's definitely not really ready to go live. Part of what was slowing me down was that the design specification and how it was difficult to create style classes to reuse since it seemed every section had something special in the spacing or whatever else.  All of that said, I barely got to do any testing and haven't written a personal summary for the intro. So I'm just not feeling good about this one. Putting together a portfolio has always been a HUGE struggle for me and I want to continue working on this one to flesh it out more. I think perhaps I got in my own way this week: not letting go of perfectionism in following the design specifictions, not getting enough sleep, and feeling intimidated by the big "P"-word (:ghost: PORTFOLIO :skull:).
