## Test your website üë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
A big part of this project is to test your page so that it works for all the most used browsers and works well for people with dissabilities.

### **1. Cross-browser testing**
You should make sure that your page is looking and function like you would want in the following web browsers:

- Google Chrome
- Firefox
- Microsoft Edge

If you're on a mac or linux computer, you can use¬†[this tool](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/remote/)¬†to test your site on Edge.

Follow the¬†[Workflows for cross browser testing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Introduction)¬†when testing your sites.

### **2. Accessibility testing**
The next step is to make sure your webpage works well for people with disabilities. You should follow each step on the¬†[Accessibility testing checklist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Accessibility)¬†at the bottom of the page and make adjustments for those errors that you find. Feel free to discuss in Slack what you find and how to solve some issues.

If you publish your website, you can use the built in screen reader on your phone for the screen reader test. Google to see how to turn it on for your phone.
