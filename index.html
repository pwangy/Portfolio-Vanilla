This is where you sell in your new self. You might combine your previous experience with your new frontend skills or basically use this area to describe yourself the way you see your role in the future. Either you do something like "Frontend + design" or more of a sentence like; "Frontend developer with a background in communications". Or if you don't see yourself as a frontend developer in the future maybe you want to write something like; "Project manager with coding skills". It's your portfolio.  -->

    <!-- ### Featured projects
    Put the projects that you are most proud of here. Make sure to mention all technologies, libraries or APIs that you have used. Don't feel like you are repeating yourself. As a recruiter looking for a React developer – the more React is mentioned – the better. If you have other code projects that are not related to this course, feel free to add them too. 

    Link your projects to their Github page and **make sure the whole area is a link**, meaning the image, headline and text. -->

    <!-- ### Other projects
    Put all of your other projects here. The more the merrier.  -->

  <!-- links to blog content block -->

    <!-- ### My Thoughts

  This is the area where you really can present yourself and your thoughts about code. It's extremely helpful for recruiters to pick your brain a little and see that you don't just code – you also reflect. 

  Put a link to your reflections for the industry assignment after each sprint here or if you have ever written anything else on this topic. If you have only made LinkedIn posts as your reflection previously, try and get a few words down after next sprint on either medium or as an article on LinkedIn. 

  **Make sure that the whole area is clickable and a link**, meaning the image, headline and text.  -->



  <!-- skill summary block -->
    <!-- ### Skills

Place ALL your skills here. Feel free to add tech skills that are not in the course but things you have since before. In the other columns, place everything that you think will be useful for a job in tech. Softwares that you know, methodologies, leadership frameworks and basically whatever. -->
